# TOTAL TIME SPENT (for now): 5 HOURS

## July 23rd, 2025 - Started the project!
I forgot to journal so here I am on the 25th rejournaling! Today I came up with my idea, and started the CAD! I'm really new to this so I learned how to use USB-A ports in KiCad!

Credit to some people in the KiCad EDA discord for helping me learn some basic schematic stuff like putting VBUS facing up and GND facing down!!  
**Time spent today: ~1.5hrs
## July 24th, 2025
Today I learned how to use USB-C ports, and tried to use a MicroSD card reader! that failed so we're scrapping the microsd card... now just 2 usba and 2 usbc :(
