# TOTAL TIME SPENT: 17 HOURS AND 45 MINUTES (how did it take this long ðŸ˜­)

## July 23rd, 2025 - Started the project!
I forgot to journal so here I am on the 25th rejournaling! Today I came up with my idea, and started the CAD! I'm really new to this so I learned how to use USB-A ports in KiCad!

Credit to some people in the KiCad EDA discord for helping me learn some basic schematic stuff like putting VBUS facing up and GND facing down!!  
**Time spent today: ~1.5hrs**
## July 24th, 2025
Today I learned how to use USB-C ports, and tried to use a MicroSD card reader! that failed so we're scrapping the microsd card... now just 2 usba and 2 usbc :(

**Time spent today: 2.5hrs**

## July 25th, 2025
Today I found out how to use and wire a SL2.1A piece to control my USB hub! I also finished the schematic (image below) and started doing the placement for the PCB! Oh and I also added some mounting holes...

I also did a lot of the wiring... But it ended up not working and I had to redo it :noooo:
**Time spent today: 2.5hrs**

## July 26th, 2025
I did a lot of the wiring.... and then realized that I was using the wrong footprint :noooo:, oh and I DID SOME CAD!!! I REDID THE BASE 4 TIMES CUZ I DIDNT KNOW HOW TO USE MOUNTING HOLES ðŸ˜­
**Time spent today: 1h30m**

## July 27th, 2025
Didn't do much today, went to church, just did some CADding!

Boy oh boy... Today I grinded..    
Today I:
1. Did all the routing... twice... then learned how to diff pair and ground pour so my thing does explode ðŸ˜­
2. DID ALL THE CAD ðŸ’ª HAD TO FIX MY FREAKING MOUTNING HOLES LIKE 17 TIMES BUT ITS OK :pf:
3. GOT THE BOM (will upload soon)

Update from evening:
APPARENTLY I NEED A CRYSTAL SO MY PCB DOESNT EXPLODE ðŸ˜­ so i did that... and had to reroute again.... i actually used a ground pour and differential pair this time!! are you proud of me cyao

**Time spent today: 6hrs**

## July 29th, 2025
I wake up, think I'm ready to ship because i finished the CAD and all, and then i see that that little crystall IS TALL.
     
so i redid the cad in about 45mins just making it taller because i am disgusting with fusion
   
here's 2 photos of the cad, one transparent one not

I'm now going to ship this and add the time it takes to do that to my journal.    

Update: I USED THE WRONG CRYSTAL ðŸ˜­ I had to redo the cad and the PCB wiring and footprint and adjust my BOM.

This is the new case with new PCB ^^     

AND WE'RE DONE!!! HAD TO REDO ALL THE FILES IN THE GITHUB AND ALL THAT BUT I'M DONE!
**Time spent today: 2hrs 45mins**

## Assembly
Had some PCB issues, the crystal was 8mhz but i cut the trace and made it ran on the IC so we good.
**Time spent: 2 hours**
