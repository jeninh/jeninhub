# Information :D
I made this because I just got a new laptop (yaaaay!!) and I wanted more ports. I also have a setup that connects my laptop to a wireless mouse, mic, monitor, etc when it's on my desk and I wanted to plug them all in at once!  
This hub has 2 USB-C ports and 1 USB-A ports

# PCB!!! THIS TOOK ME SO LONG ðŸ˜­

This is the schematic! See that i also added a crystal connected to the SL2.1A :D so yeah

Difficulties I had with the case:
- LINING UP THE HOLES.... UGH MY MEASUREMENT SKILLS ARE DISGUSTING
- Sizing the height... I had to adjust this multiple times, especially after adding and switching the crystal
- Using fusion360 ðŸ˜­this is like my 2nd time

Now... you may be wondering... why am I getting all these out of pocket?    
Well... I need to finish my project by August 7 which is about 9 days from when I am writing this and I defenitely won't get expedited shipping for free... so I might as well pay for my PCB and PCBA out of pocket so I get it on time!    
For the rest of the items... I am 3d printing the case myself and I have screws and nuts :)

## Notes
I like trains     
Rudy and Valen are goated for helping me with this      
Please accept me ðŸ˜­ I am literally doing all of this out of pocket except for US$5 ðŸ˜­
